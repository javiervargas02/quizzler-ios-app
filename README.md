# Quizzler-iOS13

Welcome to **Quizzler-iOS13**, an engaging and interactive quiz app developed as part of a learning journey to master iOS development. This project showcases various Swift programming techniques, user interface components, and app logic that come together to create a fun and educational experience.

> This is a companion project to The App Brewery's Complete App Development Bootcamp, check out the full course at [www.appbrewery.co](https://www.appbrewery.co/)

## Project Overview

Quizzler-iOS13 is designed to challenge users with a series of true/false questions. The questions are shuffled each time the app is launched to ensure a fresh experience for the user every time they play. The goal is to provide a simple yet intuitive interface that makes learning enjoyable and interactive.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Question Handling**: The quiz logic uses a shuffled 2D array to present questions in a random order, preventing repetitiveness and ensuring variety in each playthrough.
- **Score Tracking**: Users receive immediate feedback on their progress with a live score tracker that updates as they answer each question.
- **Progress Indicator**: A progress bar visually represents the user's advancement through the quiz, adding a layer of motivation to complete the challenge.
- **User Interaction**: Easy-to-use true/false buttons allow users to engage with the quiz seamlessly, making it accessible to people of all ages.
- **End-of-Quiz Summary**: At the end of the quiz, users are provided with a summary of their performance, showcasing their score out of the total number of questions.

## Learning Outcomes

This project serves as an excellent demonstration of iOS development skills, including:

- **Swift Basics**: Understanding core Swift concepts like variables, conditionals, loops, and control flow.
- **UI Components**: Working with UIKit elements such as labels, buttons, and progress bars to build a responsive user interface.
- **Data Structures**: Using arrays and 2D arrays to manage and manipulate quiz data.
- **User Interaction**: Implementing user actions and dynamically updating the UI in response to those interactions.
- **Ternary Operator Usage**: Leveraging Swift's ternary operator for concise and efficient decision-making within the code.
- **Code Organization**: Writing clean, structured, and readable code for future scalability and maintenance.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: The primary programming language used for building the app.
- **UIKit**: Apple's UI framework to design and develop the interface components.
- **Xcode**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used to write and test the code.

## How It Works

1. **Starting the Quiz**: When the app is launched, a shuffled question is displayed, ensuring that the order changes each time you play.
2. **Answering Questions**: Users press either the "True" or "False" button to respond to each question.
3. **Real-Time Feedback**: The app immediately updates the score and moves to the next question, showing real-time progress on a progress bar.
4. **Quiz Completion**: When all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and a message indicating the end of the quiz.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally on your iOS device or simulator:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in **Xcode**.
3. Build and run the project on your simulator or a connected iOS device.

## Future Improvements

In the future, the project will be enhanced by incorporating Swift structures (Structs), the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, and object-oriented programming principles. These improvements aim to optimize the codebase, making it more modular, scalable, and maintainable, while also deepening the understanding of these core concepts in Swift.
